# Tictactoe

Simple angular app for a local game of tic-tac-toe. I created this app to start learning Angular by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0bBLvWXBvc) tutorial.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
